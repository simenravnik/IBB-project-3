# Face recognition with LBP algorithm

## Implemented

1. Retrieve dataset (in our case `yale` dataset) for face recognition. (Available at http://vision.ucsd.edu/content/yale-face-database#:~:text=Synopsis,sleepy%2C%20surprised%2C%20and%20wink.)
2. Implement LBP algorithm for feature extraction (histogram)
3. Predict idenity based on features extracted from LBP using kNN and SVM
4. Find optimal values for number of points and radius in LBP
5. Plot visualizations
